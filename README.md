# Jubeatsu-Mod
An osu! Mod to create Jubeatsu Storyboards

## Please note
The code contains a lot of garbage. I was sleepy and I don't know what I did there anymore.

There might be too much useless code.

## What is this Mod?
This mod allows you to create a Jubeatsu Storyboard for your Jubeatsu Setup. It's pretty simple, but requires you a little of work.

## [Download](https://mega.nz/#F!TkVyVSqJ!kmXJuApOC9UxOrbP7A6O0A)
The download is currently only available for Windows (and most likely will stay Windows only).

## Getting Started

### Create a Beatmap
* To create a Beatmap, you'll need the Jubeatsu mask found in the downloads.
* Please note: It **must** be located under the folder **sb** in your Beatmap Song Directory.
* The Circle Size should be set to **0**, the rest is up to you.
* Please insert the marker Folder inside your Folder as well.
* Recommended are the Standard Skin settings (invisible circles etc.), these are also in the Downloads.
* When creating the Beatmap, place the Circles inside the Mask its Squares. Please, be accurate.
* **ONLY HITCIRCLES ARE ALLOWED** but you can even put in Sliders and Spinners, though they'll be displayed as circles.

### Creating the Jubeatsu Storyboard
* Open up the Application found in the Downloads Section.
* Pick an .osu File.
* If you have a .osb file, save it or it will be overwritten.
* **(Optional:)** Merge your .osb Settings with the new-created .osb Settings.
* Press Create Storyboard for Jubeatsu
* You will be prompted to overwrite your .osb File, if existing.
* Now wait until the Progress Bar goes 100%.
* In your Beatmap Folder, Event_Filename.txt will be created.
* Copy everything in the Text Document and paste it under [Events] in your .osu Difficulty which you have selected.
* Done!


## Skinning
If you'd like to skin your Jubeatsu Animations etc, please try to keep the same Size and use the same Filenames.

If you don't do any of these, your overlay might break.

Feel free to experiment around though! :)

* For the Animations of the Squares, move to the marker folder and change the PNGs inside there.
* For the Mask, the Buttons etc., you go into the sb folder and change these accordingly.

## FAQ
**Q:** I get errors! What to do?!

**A:** Open up an issue in GitHub and I'll try to resolve it ASAP.

**Q:** Can I map anything with this?

**A:** You can indeed map anything, but it'll look odd. You don't need the mask, it will animate anything you want.

**Q:** I can't find something in the Readme. Where can I ask questions?

**A:** You can also open up an issue for that and I'll try to add it into the Readme ASAP.
